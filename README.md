# rostalker
Testing for communication across devices/robots, using ROS kinetic on an ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Please note
The two devices begin used are a HP notebook running ubuntu 16.04 LTS and a ubuntu 16.04 64 bit virtual machine in virtual box

### Success
Was able to communicate, going to start updating more

# TODO 
1. get client-server model running 
2. Communicate custom messages 
3. test out the rostopic feature, does it go both ways? can the master be told information from the slave and vice versa?
